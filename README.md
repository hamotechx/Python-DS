# Python Data Structures for Beginners

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DS_Part1.ipynb`) that serves as a comprehensive, hands-on guide to the fundamental data structures in Python. It's designed for beginners who want to learn how to store, manage, and manipulate data effectively using Python's built-in data types.

## 🚀 Content Overview

The notebook provides detailed explanations and executable code examples for the following data structures:

1.  **Lists**: Ordered, mutable, and versatile collections.
2.  **Tuples**: Ordered and immutable collections, ideal for fixed data.
3.  **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements.
4.  **Dictionaries**: Unordered collections of key-value pairs for fast lookups.

## ✨ Features

-   **Clear Explanations**: Each data structure is introduced with its definition, properties, and common use cases.
-   **Code Examples**: Practical examples demonstrate how to perform common operations such as:
    -   Creating data structures
    -   Accessing, modifying, adding, and removing elements
    -   Slicing and iterating
    -   Using comprehensions to create data structures concisely
-   **Choosing the Right Data Structure**: A dedicated section provides guidelines on when to use each data structure based on requirements like order, mutability, and uniqueness.
-   **Nested and Combined Data Structures**: Explore more complex data representations by combining different data structures, such as:
    -   Lists of Tuples
    -   Dictionaries with List values
    -   Lists of Dictionaries

## 📖 How to Use

To get started with this guide, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hamotechx/Python-DS.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-DS
    ```
3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook DS_Part1.ipynb
    ```
4.  **Run the cells**: You can run each cell in the notebook to see the code in action and understand the output.

Alternatively, you can use an online environment like Google Colab by uploading the `.ipynb` file.

## 📝 Summary of Data Structures Covered

-   **Lists**: Learn how to create dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink. Perfect for ordered sequences of items.
-   **Tuples**: Understand how to use immutable sequences for data that should not change.
-   **Sets**: Discover how to work with unique elements and perform mathematical set operations like union and intersection.
-   **Dictionaries**: Master the use of key-value pairs for efficient data storage and retrieval.

This notebook is a great starting point for anyone new to Python or programming, providing the foundational knowledge needed for more advanced data science and software development tasks.
